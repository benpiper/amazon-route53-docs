<h1 id="geolocation-routing-in-private-hosted-zones">Geolocation routing in private hosted zones<a name="routing-policy-geo-phz"></a></h1>
<p>For private hosted zones, Route 53 responds to DNS queries based on the AWS Region of the VPC that the query originated from. For the list of AWS Regions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html">Regions and zones</a> in the <em>Amazon EC2 user guide</em>.</p>
<p>If the DNS query originates from an on-premises part of a hybrid network, it will be considered as having originated from the AWS Region that the VPC is located in.</p>
<p>If you include health checks, you can create default records for: + IP addresses that aren’t mapped to geographic locations. + DNS queries that come from locations that you haven’t created geolocation records for.</p>
<p>If the geolocation record for the DNS query’s region is unhealthy, the default record will be returned (if it is healthy).</p>
<p>In the example configuration in the following figure, DNS queries coming from an us-east-1 AWS Region (Virginia) will be routed to the 1.1.1.1 endpoint.</p>
