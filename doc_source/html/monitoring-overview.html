<p>Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of your AWS solutions. You should collect monitoring data from all of the parts of your AWS solution so that you can more easily debug a multi-point failure if one occurs. However, before you start monitoring, you should create a monitoring plan that includes answers to the following questions: + What are your monitoring goals? + What resources will you monitor? + How often will you monitor these resources? + What monitoring tools will you use? + Who will perform the monitoring tasks? + Who should be notified when something goes wrong?</p>
