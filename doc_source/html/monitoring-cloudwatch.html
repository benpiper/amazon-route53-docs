<h1 id="monitoring-your-resources-with-amazon-route-53-health-checks-and-amazon-cloudwatch">Monitoring your resources with Amazon Route 53 health checks and Amazon CloudWatch<a name="monitoring-cloudwatch"></a></h1>
<p>You can monitor your resources by creating Amazon Route 53 health checks, which use CloudWatch to collect and process raw data into readable, near real-time metrics. These statistics are recorded for a period of two weeks, so that you can access historical information and gain a better perspective on how your resources are performing. By default, metric data for Route 53 health checks is automatically sent to CloudWatch at one-minute intervals.</p>
<p>For more information about Route 53 health checks, see <a href="monitoring-health-checks.html">Monitoring health checks using CloudWatch</a>. For more information about CloudWatch, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsCloudWatch.html">What is Amazon CloudWatch?</a> in the <em>Amazon CloudWatch User Guide</em>.</p>
<h2 id="metrics-and-dimensions-for-route-53-health-checks">Metrics and dimensions for Route 53 health checks<a name="metrics_dimensions_health_checks"></a></h2>
<p>When you create a health check, Amazon Route 53 starts to send metrics and dimensions once a minute to CloudWatch about the resource that you specify. The Route 53 console lets you view the status of your health checks. You can also use the following procedures to view the metrics in the CloudWatch console or view them by using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).</p>
<p><strong>To view metrics using the CloudWatch console</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open the CloudWatch console at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the navigation pane, choose <strong>Metrics</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>On the <strong>All Metrics</strong> tab, choose <strong>Route 53</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <strong>Health Check Metrics</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>To view metrics using the AWS CLI</strong> + At a command prompt, use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>1. aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace &quot;AWS/Route53&quot;</code></pre>

<h3 id="cloudwatch-metrics-for-route-53-health-checks">CloudWatch metrics for Route 53 health checks<a name="cloudwatch-metrics"></a></h3>
<p>The <code>AWS/Route53</code> namespace includes the following metrics for Route 53 health checks.</p>
<p><strong>ChildHealthCheckHealthyCount</strong><br />
For a calculated health check, the number of health checks that are healthy among the health checks that Route 53 is monitoring.<br />
Valid statistics: Average (recommended), Minimum, Maximum<br />
Units: Healthy health checks</p>
<p><strong>ConnectionTime</strong><br />
The average time, in milliseconds, that it took Route 53 health checkers to establish a TCP connection with the endpoint. You can view <code>ConnectionTime</code> for a health check either across all regions or for a selected geographic region.<br />
Valid statistics: Average (recommended), Minimum, Maximum<br />
Units: Milliseconds</p>
<p><strong>HealthCheckPercentageHealthy</strong><br />
The percentage of Route 53 health checkers that consider the selected endpoint to be healthy. You can view <code>HealthCheckPercentageHealthy</code> only across all regions; data is not available for a selected region.<br />
You set this up under the <strong>Latency graphs</strong> option. For more information, see <a href="monitoring-health-check-latency.html">Monitoring the latency between health checkers and your endpoint</a>.<br />
Valid statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum<br />
Units: Percent</p>
<p><strong>HealthCheckStatus</strong><br />
The status of the health check endpoint that CloudWatch is checking. <strong>1</strong> indicates healthy, and <strong>0</strong> indicates unhealthy. You can view <code>HealthCheckStatus</code> only across all regions; data is not available for a selected region.<br />
You set this up under the <strong>Latency graphs</strong> option. For more information, see <a href="monitoring-health-check-latency.html">Monitoring the latency between health checkers and your endpoint</a>.<br />
Valid statistics: Minimum<br />
Units: none</p>
<p><strong>SSLHandshakeTime</strong><br />
The average time, in milliseconds, that it took Route 53 health checkers to complete the SSL handshake. You can view <code>SSLHandshakeTime</code> for a health check either across all regions or for a selected geographic region.<br />
Valid statistics: Average (recommended), Minimum, Maximum<br />
Units: Milliseconds</p>
<p><strong>TimeToFirstByte</strong><br />
The average time, in milliseconds, that it took Route 53 health checkers to receive the first byte of the response to an HTTP or HTTPS request. You can view <code>TimeToFirstByte</code> for a health check either across all regions or for a selected geographic region.<br />
Valid statistics: Average (recommended), Minimum, Maximum<br />
Units: Milliseconds</p>
<h3 id="dimensions-for-route-53-health-check-metrics">Dimensions for Route 53 health check metrics<a name="cloudwatch-dimensions-route-53-metrics"></a></h3>
<p>Route 53 metrics for health checks use the <code>AWS/Route53</code> namespace and provide metrics for <code>HealthCheckId</code>. When retrieving metrics, you must supply the <code>HealthCheckId</code> dimension.</p>
<p>In addition, for <code>ConnectionTime</code>, <code>SSLHandshakeTime</code>, and <code>TimeToFirstByte</code>, you can optionally specify <code>Region</code>. If you omit <code>Region</code>, CloudWatch returns metrics across all regions. If you include <code>Region</code>, CloudWatch returns metrics only for the specified region.</p>
