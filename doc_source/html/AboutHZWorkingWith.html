<p>A public hosted zone is a container that holds information about how you want to route traffic on the internet for a specific domain, such as example.com, and its subdomains (acme.example.com, zenith.example.com). You get a public hosted zone in one of two ways: + When you register a domain with Route 53, we create a hosted zone for you automatically. + When you transfer DNS service for an existing domain to Route 53, you start by creating a hosted zone for the domain. For more information, see <a href="MigratingDNS.html">Making Amazon Route 53 the DNS service for an existing domainMaking Route 53 the DNS service for an existing domain</a>.</p>
<p>In both cases, you then create records in the hosted zone to specify how you want to route traffic for the domain and subdomains. For example, you might create a record to route traffic for www.example.com to a CloudFront distribution or to a web server in your data center. For more information about records, see <a href="rrsets-working-with.html">Working with records</a>.</p>
<p>This topic explains how to use the Amazon Route 53 console to create, list, and delete public hosted zones.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br />
You can also use a Route 53 <em>private</em> hosted zone to route traffic within one or more VPCs that you create with the Amazon VPC service. For more information, see <a href="hosted-zones-private.html">Working with private hosted zones</a>.</p>
