<h1 id="how-domain-registration-works">How domain registration works<a name="welcome-domain-registration"></a></h1>
<p>If you want to create a website or a web application, you start by registering the name of your website, known as a <a href="route-53-concepts.html#route-53-concepts-domain-name">domain name</a>. Your domain name is the name, such as example.com, that your users enter in a browser to display your website.</p>
<p>Here’s an overview of how you register a domain name with Amazon Route 53:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>You choose a domain name and confirm that it’s available, meaning that no one else has registered the domain name that you want.</p>
<p>If the domain name you want is already in use, you can try other names or try changing only the <em>top-level domain</em>, such as .com, to another top-level domain, such as .ninja or .hockey. For a list of the top-level domains that Route 53 supports, see <a href="registrar-tld-list.html">Domains that you can register with Amazon Route 53</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You register the domain name with Route 53. When you register a domain, you provide names and contact information for the domain owner and other contacts.</p>
<p>When you register a domain with Route 53, the service automatically makes itself the DNS service for the domain by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creates a <a href="route-53-concepts.html#route-53-concepts-hosted-zone">hosted zone</a> that has the same name as your domain.</li>
<li>Assigns a set of four name servers to the hosted zone. When someone uses a browser to access your website, such as www.example.com, these name servers tell the browser where to find your resources, such as a web server or an Amazon S3 bucket. (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> is object storage for storing and retrieving any amount of data from anywhere on the web. A bucket is a container for objects that you store in S3.)</li>
<li>Gets the name servers from the hosted zone and adds them to the domain.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see <a href="welcome-dns-service.html">How internet traffic is routed to your website or web application</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of the registration process, we send your information to the registrar for the domain. The <a href="route-53-concepts.html#route-53-concepts-domain-registrar">domain registrar</a> is either Amazon Registrar, Inc. or our registrar associate, Gandi. To find out who the registrar is for your domain, see <a href="find-your-registrar.html">Finding your registrar</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The registrar sends your information to the <em>registry</em> for the domain. A registry is a company that sells domain registrations for one or more top-level domains, such as .com.</p></li>
<li><p>The registry stores the information about your domain in their own database and also stores some of the information in the public WHOIS database.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For more information about how to register a domain name, see <a href="domain-register.html">Registering a new domain</a>.</p>
<p>If you already registered a domain name with another registrar, you can choose to transfer the domain registration to Route 53. This isn’t required to use other Route 53 features. For more information, see <a href="domain-transfer-to-route-53.html">Transferring registration for a domain to Amazon Route 53</a>.</p>
