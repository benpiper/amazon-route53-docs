<p>If you’re creating failover records in a private hosted zone, note the following: + Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the health of an endpoint within a VPC by IP address, you must assign a public IP address to the instance in the VPC. + You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm with the metric, and then create a health check that is based on the data stream for the alarm. For example, you might create a CloudWatch metric that checks the status of the EC2 <code>StatusCheckFailed</code> metric, add an alarm to the metric, and then create a health check that is based on the data stream for the alarm to check instances within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that only have private IP addresses. For information about creating CloudWatch metrics and alarms by using the CloudWatch console, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/">Amazon CloudWatch User Guide</a>.</p>
