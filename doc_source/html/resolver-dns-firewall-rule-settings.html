<h1 id="rule-settings-in-dns-firewall">Rule settings in DNS Firewall<a name="resolver-dns-firewall-rule-settings"></a></h1>
<p>When you create or edit a rule in a DNS Firewall rule group, you specify the following values:</p>
<p><strong>Name</strong><br />
A unique identifier for the rule in the rule group.</p>
<p><strong>(Optional) Description</strong><br />
A short description that provides more information about the rule.</p>
<p><strong>Domain list</strong><br />
The list of domains that the rule inspects for. You can create and manage your own domain list or you can subscribe to a domain list that AWS manages for you. For more information, see <a href="resolver-dns-firewall-domain-lists.html">Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall domain lists</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong><br />
How you want DNS Firewall to handle a DNS query whose domain name matches the specifications in the rule’s domain list. For more information, see <a href="resolver-dns-firewall-rule-actions.html">Rule actions in DNS Firewall</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Priority</strong><br />
Unique positive integer setting for the rule within the rule group that determines processing order. DNS Firewall inspects DNS queries against the rules in a rule group starting with the lowest numeric priority setting and going up. You can change a rule’s priority at any time, for example to change the order of processing or make space for other rules.</p>
