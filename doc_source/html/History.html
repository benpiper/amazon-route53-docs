For more information, see <a href="health-checks-view-status.html">Viewing health check status and the reason for health check failures</a>. + <strong>Integration with AWS CloudTrail</strong> – Route 53 now works with CloudTrail to capture information about every request that your AWS account (including your IAM users) sends to the Route 53 API. Integrating Route 53 and CloudTrail lets you determine which requests were made to the Route 53 API, the source IP address from which each request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and more. For more information, see <a href="logging-using-cloudtrail.html">Logging Amazon Route 53 API calls with AWS CloudTrail</a>. + <strong>Quick Alarms for Health Checks</strong> – When you create a health check by using the Route 53 console, you can now simultaneously create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm for the health check and specify who to notify when Route 53 considers the endpoint unhealthy for one minute. For more information, see <a href="health-checks-creating.html">Creating and updating health checks</a>. + <strong>Tagging for Hosted Zones and Domains</strong> – You can now assign tags, which are commonly used for cost allocation, to Route 53 hosted zones and domains. For more information, see <a href="tagging-resources.html">Tagging Amazon Route 53 resources</a>.</p>
<p><strong>February 5, 2015</strong><br />

With this release, you can now edit the comment that you specified for a hosted zone when you created it. In the console, you just click the pencil icon next to the <strong>Comment</strong> field and enter a new value. For more information about changing the comment by using the Route 53 API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHostedZoneComment.html">UpdateHostedZoneComment</a> in the <em>Amazon Route 53 API Reference</em>.</p>
<p><strong>November 5, 2014</strong><br />
With this release, Route 53 adds the following new features:<br />
+ <strong>Private DNS for VPCs created using the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud service</strong> – You can now use Route 53 to manage your internal domain names for VPCs without exposing DNS data to the public internet. For more information, see <a href="hosted-zones-private.html">Working with private hosted zones</a>. + <strong>Health check failure reasons</strong> – You can now see the current status of a selected health check, as well as details on why the health check last failed, as reported by each of the Route 53 health checkers. The status includes the HTTP status code, and failure reasons include information about numerous types of failures, such as string matching failures and response timeouts. For more information, see <a href="health-checks-view-status.html">Viewing health check status and the reason for health check failures</a>. + <strong>Reusable delegation sets</strong> – You can now apply the same set of four authoritative name servers, known collectively as a delegation set, to multiple hosted zones that correspond with different domain names. This greatly simplifies the process of migrating DNS service to Route 53 and managing large numbers of hosted zones. Using reusable delegation sets currently requires that you use the Route 53 API or an AWS SDK. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/">Amazon Route 53 API Reference</a>. + <strong>Improved geolocation routing</strong> – We further improved the accuracy of geolocation routing by adding support for the edns-client-subnet extension of EDNS0. For more information, see <a href="routing-policy-geo.html">Geolocation routing</a>. + <strong>Support for Signature v4</strong> – You can now sign all Route 53 API requests using Signature version 4.

<p><strong>July 2, 2014</strong><br />
With this release, you can now do the following:<br />
+ Edit most values in health checks. For more information, see <a href="health-checks-creating-deleting.html">Creating, updating, and deleting health checks</a>. + Use the Route 53 API to get a list of the IP ranges that Route 53 health checkers use to check the health of your resources. You can use these IP addresses to configure your router and firewall rules to allow health checkers to check the health of your resources. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_GetCheckerIpRanges.html">GetCheckerIpRanges</a> in the <em>Amazon Route 53 API Reference</em>. + Assign cost allocation tags to health checks, which also lets you assign a name to health checks. For more information, see <a href="health-checks-tagging.html">Naming and tagging health checks</a>. + Use the Route 53 API to get the number of health checks that are associated with your AWS account. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_GetHealthCheckCount.html">GetHealthCheckCount</a> in the <em>Amazon Route 53 API Reference</em>.</p>
<p><strong>April 30, 2014</strong><br />
With this release, you can now create health checks and use a domain name instead of an IP address to specify the endpoint. This is helpful when an endpoint’s IP address either is not fixed or is served by multiple IPs, such as Amazon EC2 or Amazon RDS instances. For more information, see <a href="health-checks-creating.html">Creating and updating health checks</a>.<br />
In addition, some information about using the Route 53 API that formerly appeared in the <em>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</em> has been moved. Now all API documentation appears in the <em>Amazon Route 53 API Reference</em>.</p>
<p><strong>April 18, 2014</strong><br />
With this release, Route 53 passes a different value in the <code>Host</code> header when the health check <strong>Port</strong> value is <strong>443</strong> and the <strong>Protocol</strong> value is <strong>HTTPS</strong>. During a health check, Route 53 now passes to the endpoint a <code>Host</code> header that contains the value of the <strong>Host Name</strong> field. If you created the health check by using the <code>CreateHealthCheck</code> API action, this is the value of the <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code> element.<br />
For more information, see <a href="health-checks-creating-deleting.html">Creating, updating, and deleting health checks</a>.</p>
<p><strong>April 9, 2014</strong><br />
With this release, you can now view what percentage of Route 53 health checkers are currently reporting that an endpoint is healthy.<br />
In addition, behavior of the Health Check Status metric in Amazon CloudWatch now shows only zero (if your endpoint was unhealthy during a given time period) or one (if the endpoint was healthy for that time period). The metric no longer shows values between 0 and 1 reflecting the portion of Route 53 health checks that are reporting the endpoint as healthy.<br />
