<h1 id="resending-authorization-and-confirmation-emails">Resending authorization and confirmation emails<a name="domain-click-email-link"></a></h1>
<p>For several operations related to domain registration, ICANN requires that we get authorization from the registrant contact for the domain or confirmation that the email address for the registrant contact is valid. To get authorization or confirmation, we send an email that contains a link. You have between 3 and 15 days to click the link, depending on the operation and the top-level domain. After that time, the link stops working.</p>
<p>If you don’t click the link in the email in the allotted amount of time, ICANN generally requires that we suspend the domain or cancel the operation, depending on what you were trying to do:</p>
<p><strong>Register a domain</strong><br />
We suspend the domain, so that it’s not accessible on the internet. To resend the confirmation email, see <a href="#domain-click-email-link-register-procedure">To resend the confirmation email for a domain registration</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Geographic TLDs only – Transfer a domain to Amazon Route 53</strong><br />
If you’re transferring a domain that has a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar-tld-list.html#registrar-tld-list-geographic">geographic TLD</a>, we cancel the transfer. To resend the authorization email, see <a href="#domain-click-email-link-transfer-procedure">To resend the authorization email for a domain transfer</a>.<br />
Authorization isn’t required for domains that have a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar-tld-list.html#registrar-tld-list-generic">generic TLD</a>, such as .com, .net, or .org.</p>
<p><strong>Change the name or email address of the registrant contact for the domain (the owner)</strong><br />
We cancel the change. To resend the authorization email, see <a href="#domain-click-email-link-update-procedure">To resend the authorization email to update the registrant contact or delete a domain</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Delete a domain</strong><br />
We cancel the deletion request. To resend the authorization email, see <a href="#domain-click-email-link-update-procedure">To resend the authorization email to update the registrant contact or delete a domain</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Geographic TLDs only – Transfer a domain from Route 53 to another registrar</strong><br />
If you’re transferring a domain that has a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar-tld-list.html#registrar-tld-list-geographic">geographic TLD</a>, the new registrar cancels the transfer.<br />

<p>We always send confirmation and authorization emails to the email address for the registrant contact for a domain. For some TLDs, we’re required to send email to the old and new email addresses for the registrant contact in the following cases: + You’re changing the email address for a domain that is already registered with Amazon Route 53 + You’re changing the email address for a domain that you’re transferring to Route 53</p>

<p><strong>To resend the confirmation email for a domain registration</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Check the email address for the registrant contact and, if necessary, update it. For more information, see <a href="domain-update-contacts.html">Updating contact information and ownership for a domain</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Check the spam folder in your email application for an email from one of the following email addresses.</p>
<p>If too much time has passed, the link won’t work any longer, but you’ll know where to look for the confirmation email when we send you another one.<br />
****<br />
<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-click-email-link.html">[See the AWS documentation website for more details]</a></p></li>
<li><p>Use the Amazon Route 53 console to resend the confirmation email:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/">https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the navigation pane, choose <strong>Registered domains</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the name of the domain that you want to resend the email for.</p></li>
<li><p>In the warning box with the heading “Your domain might be suspended,” choose <strong>Send email again</strong>. <strong>Note</strong><br />
If there’s no warning box, you already confirmed that the email address for the registrant contact is valid.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>If you encounter issues while resending the confirmation email, you can contact AWS Support for free. For more information, see <a href="domain-contact-support.html">Contacting AWS Support about domain registration issues</a>.<a name="domain-click-email-link-transfer-procedure"></a></p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>To resend the authorization email for a domain transfer</strong></p>
<p>This method doesn’t work for .jp domain transfer out requests.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Use the method provided by the current domain registrar to confirm that privacy protection for the domain is disabled. If not, disable it.</p>
<p>We send the authorization email to the email address that the current registrar saved in the WHOIS database. When privacy protection is enabled, that email address typically is obfuscated. The current registrar might not forward to your actual email address the email that Amazon Route 53 sends to the email address in the WHOIS database. <strong>Note</strong><br />
If the current registrar for the domain won’t let you turn off privacy protection, we can still transfer the domain if you specified a valid authorization code in <a href="domain-transfer-to-route-53.html#domain-transfer-to-route-53-request-transfer">Step 5: Request the transfer</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Check the email address for the registrant contact and, if necessary, update it. Use the method provided by the current registrar for the domain.</p></li>
<li><p>Check the spam folder in your email application for an email from one of the following email addresses.</p>
<p>If too much time has passed, the link won’t work any longer, but you’ll know where to look for the authorization email when we send you another one.<br />
****<br />
<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-click-email-link.html">[See the AWS documentation website for more details]</a></p></li>
<li><p>If the transfer is no longer in process (if we already canceled it because too much time has passed), request the transfer again, and we’ll send you another authorization email. <strong>Note</strong><br />
For the first 15 days after you request a transfer, you can determine the status of the transfer by checking the <strong>Notifications</strong> table on the <strong>Dashboard</strong> page in the Route 53 console. After 15 days, use the AWS CLI to get the status. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/route53domains/index.html">route53domains</a> in the <em>AWS CLI Command Reference</em>.</p>
<p>If the transfer is still in progress, perform the following steps to resend the authorization email.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/">https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Notifications</strong> table, find the domain that you want to transfer.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Status</strong> column for that domain, choose <strong>Resend email</strong>.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>If you encounter issues while resending the authorization email for a domain transfer, you can contact AWS Support for free.
