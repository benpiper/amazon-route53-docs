<h1 id="what-is-amazon-route-53">What is Amazon Route 53?<a name="Welcome"></a></h1>
<p>Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. You can use Route 53 to perform three main functions in any combination: domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking.</p>
<p>If you choose to use Route 53 for all three functions, be sure to follow the order below:</p>
<p><strong>1. Register domain names</strong><br />
Your website needs a name, such as example.com. Route 53 lets you register a name for your website or web application, known as a <em>domain name</em>.<br />
+ For an overview, see <a href="welcome-domain-registration.html">How domain registration works</a>. + For a procedure, see <a href="domain-register.html">Registering a new domain</a>. + For a tutorial that takes you through registering a domain and creating a simple website in an Amazon S3 bucket, see <a href="getting-started.html">Getting started with Amazon Route 53</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2. Route internet traffic to the resources for your domain</strong><br />
When a user opens a web browser and enters your domain name (example.com) or subdomain name (acme.example.com) in the address bar, Route 53 helps connect the browser with your website or web application.<br />
+ For an overview, see <a href="welcome-dns-service.html">How internet traffic is routed to your website or web application</a>. + For procedures, see <a href="dns-configuring.html">Configuring Amazon Route 53 as your DNS service</a>. + For a procedure on how to route email to Amazon WorkMail, see <a href="routing-to-workmail.html">Routing traffic to Amazon WorkMail</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. Check the health of your resources</strong><br />
Route 53 sends automated requests over the internet to a resource, such as a web server, to verify that it’s reachable, available, and functional. You also can choose to receive notifications when a resource becomes unavailable and choose to route internet traffic away from unhealthy resources.<br />
