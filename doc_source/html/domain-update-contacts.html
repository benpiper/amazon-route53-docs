<p>For the administrative and technical contacts for a domain, you can change all contact information without having to authorize the changes. For more information, see <a href="#domain-update-contacts-basic">Updating contact information for a domain</a>.</p>
<p>For the registrant contact, you can change most values without having to authorize the changes. However, for some TLDs, changing the owner of a domain requires authorization. For more information, see the applicable topic.</p>

<h2 id="who-is-the-owner-of-a-domain">Who is the owner of a domain?<a name="domain-update-contacts-who-is-domain-owner"></a></h2>
<p>When the contact type is <strong>Person</strong> and you change the <strong>First Name</strong> or <strong>Last Name</strong> fields for the registrant contact, you change the owner of the domain.</p>
<p>When the contact type is any value except <strong>Person</strong> and you change <strong>Organization</strong>, you change the owner of the domain.</p>
<p>Note the following about changing the owner of a domain: + For some TLDs, there’s a fee to change the owner of a domain. To determine whether there’s a fee for the TLD for your domain, see the “Change Ownership Price” column in <a href="https://d32ze2gidvkk54.cloudfront.net/Amazon_Route_53_Domain_Registration_Pricing_20140731.pdf">Amazon Route 53 Pricing for Domain Registration</a>. <strong>Note</strong><br />
You can’t use AWS credits to pay the fee, if any, to change the owner of a domain. + For some TLDs, when you change the owner of a domain, we send an authorization email to the email address for the registrant contact. The registrant contact must follow the instructions in the email to authorize the change. + For some TLDs, you need to fill out a Change of Domain Ownership Form and provide proof of identity so that an Amazon Route 53 support engineer can update the values for you. If the TLD for your domain requires a Change of Domain Ownership form, the console displays a message that links to a form for opening a support case. For more information, see <a href="#domain-update-contacts-domain-ownership-form">Changing the owner of a domain when the registry requires a Change of Domain Ownership form</a>.</p>
<h2 id="tlds-that-require-special-processing-to-change-the-owner">TLDs that require special processing to change the owner<a name="domain-update-contacts-tlds"></a></h2>
<p>When you change the owner of a domain, the registries for some TLDs require special processing. If you’re changing the owner for any of the following domains, perform the applicable procedure. If you’re changing the owner for any other domain, you can change the owner yourself, either programmatically or using the Route 53 console. See <a href="#domain-update-contacts-basic">Updating contact information for a domain</a>.</p>
<p>The following TLDs require special processing to change the owner of the domain:</p>

<p>To update contact information for a domain, perform the following procedure. <a name="domain-update-contacts-procedure"></a></p>
<p><strong>To update contact information for a domain</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/">https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the navigation pane, choose <strong>Registered Domains</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the name of the domain that you want to update contact information for.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <strong>Edit Contacts</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re changing the email address for the registrant contact, perform the following steps. If you aren’t changing the email address for the registrant contact, skip to step 6.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Change <em>only</em> the email address for the registrant contact. Don’t change any other values for any of the contacts for the domain. If you also want to change other values, you change them later in the process.</p>
<p>Choose <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p>If the new email address is an address that you have never verified is reachable, we send email to the new email address. You must choose the link in the email to verify that the new email address is valid. If you don’t verify the new email address, Route 53 suspends the domain as required by ICANN.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to change other values for the registrant, administrative, or technical contacts for the domain, return to step 1 and repeat the procedure.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Update the applicable values. For more information, see <a href="domain-register-values-specify.html">Values that you specify when you register or transfer a domain</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on the TLD for your domain and the values that you’re changing, the console might display the following message:</p>
<p>“To change the registrant name or organization, open a case.”</p>
<p>If you see that message, skip the rest of this procedure and see <a href="#domain-update-contacts-domain-ownership-form">Changing the owner of a domain when the registry requires a Change of Domain Ownership form</a> for more information.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <strong>Save</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AISPL (India) customers only</strong>: If your contact address is in India, your user agreement is with Amazon Internet Services Pvt. Ltd (AISPL), a local AWS seller in India. To change the owner of a domain when the TLD registry charges a fee to change the owner, perform the following steps to pay the fee for the extension.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Go to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/paymenthistory">Orders and Invoices</a> page in the AWS Management Console.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Payments Due</strong> section, find the applicable invoice.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Actions</strong> column, choose <strong>Verify and Pay</strong>.</p>
<p>After you pay the invoice, we change the applicable settings for the registrant contact. <strong>Important</strong><br />
If you don’t pay the invoice within five days, the invoice is canceled. To change settings for the registrant contact after an invoice is canceled, resubmit the request.</p></li>

<li><p>If you changed the domain owner, as described in <a href="#domain-update-contacts-who-is-domain-owner">Who is the owner of a domain?</a>, we send email to the registrant contact for the domain. The email asks for authorization for the change of owner.</p>
<p>If we don’t receive authorization for the change within 3 to 15 days, depending on the top-level domain, we must cancel the request as required by ICANN.</p>
<p>The email comes from one of the following email addresses.<br />
