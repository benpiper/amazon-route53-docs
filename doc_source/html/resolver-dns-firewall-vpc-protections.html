<h1 id="enabling-route-53-resolver-dns-firewall-protections-for-your-vpc">Enabling Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall protections for your VPC<a name="resolver-dns-firewall-vpc-protections"></a></h1>
<p>You enable DNS Firewall protections for your VPC by associating one or more rule groups with the VPC. Whenever a VPC is associated with a DNS Firewall rule group, Route 53 Resolver provides the following DNS Firewall protections: + Resolver routes the VPC’s outbound DNS queries through DNS Firewall, and DNS Firewall filters the queries using the associated rule groups. + Resolver enforces the settings in the VPC’s DNS Firewall configuration.</p>
<p>To provide DNS Firewall protections to your VPC, you do the following: + Create and manage associations between your DNS Firewall rule groups and your VPC. For information about rule groups, see <a href="resolver-dns-firewall-rule-groups.html">DNS Firewall rule groups and rules</a>. + Configure how you want Resolver to handle DNS queries for the VPC during a failure, for example if DNS Firewall doesn’t provide a response for a DNS query.</p>
<p><strong>To remove an association between a rule group and a VPC</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Locate the rule group’s VPC associations by following the instructions in <a href="resolver-dns-firewall-rule-group-sharing.html">the preceding procedure</a> <strong>To view a rule group’s VPC associations</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the VPC that you want to remove from the list, then choose <strong>Disassociate</strong>. Verify, and then confirm the action.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>On the rule group page, your VPC is listed in the <strong>Associated VPCs</strong> tab with the status of <strong>Disassociating</strong>. When the operation completes, DNS Firewall updates the list to remove the VPC.</p>
